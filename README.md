# STEMMA Soil Sensor for Embassy-based Projects

An API for communicating with [Adafruit's STEMMA Soil Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4026) while using embassy in a project. As [embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy) and [picoserve](https://github.com/sammhicks/picoserve) makes serving web pages from a Raspberry Pi Pico W easy, this project serves to enable the creation of REST-APIs or Web-UIs for the sensor.

Derived from https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_seesaw/.

###

See the examples folder for a simple example of how to use the library to make a web server that serves the sensor data.
